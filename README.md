<h3>Disaster Response RAG Model with Offline Bluetooth Support</h3>

<h4>Overview</h4>

This project presents a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model designed for disaster response, offering **offline functionality via Bluetooth** and **multilingual support**. The model operates with **real-time data updates** on a server, which seamlessly connects with client devices during emergencies, delivering essential, life-saving information in multiple languagesâ€”without requiring an internet connection.
#Key Features
<u>Real-Time Disaster Updates</u>: The server gathers real-time crisis data and prepares it for retrieval.
<u>Offline Accessibility</u>: Bluetooth connectivity ensures the model provides critical guidance even without network access.
<u>Personalized Assistance</u>: Tailored advice on first aid, evacuation routes, and emergency contacts.
<u>Multilingual Support</u>: Reach broader audiences with support for multiple languages.
Location-Based Alerts: Localized information such as flood alerts, available even offline.
